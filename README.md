# Webflow React Components

A collection of independent React components meant for embedding in Webflow. Inspired by Webflow's blog article: [How to add React components in Webflow](https://webflow.com/blog/react-components-in-webflow).

## Overview

This repository contains a suite of standalone React components designed specifically for integration with Webflow sites. Each component is developed, built, and deployed independently, allowing for maximum flexibility and minimal dependencies between components.

## Getting Started

To work with a specific component, navigate to its corresponding directory and refer to the README file within that folder.

## Components

- **sdk-matrix**: A syntax highlighting component for showcasing SDK code examples across different languages and frameworks.

## Embedding in Webflow

Each component comes with specific instructions for embedding in Webflow. Generally, the process involves:

- Building the component
- Deploying to AWS S3
- Adding/updating the necessary script tags to your Webflow site
- Creating a mounting point in your Webflow page

For specific embedding details, please refer to the README within each component directory.
